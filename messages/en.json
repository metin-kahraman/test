    "MainContent": "Implants are titanium screws that are used to treat missing teeth and are placed inside the jawbone. The dental prosthesis is placed on these screws. The advantage of implant treatment over other treatments is that neighboring teeth are not harmed. In other words, neighboring teeth do not need to be cut. The implant acts as a tooth root and you can eat, talk and laugh comfortably like a natural tooth. Dental implant surgery also involves a surgical process that replaces the tooth roots with metal, screw-like posts and replaces damaged or missing teeth with artificial teeth that look and function very much like real teeth. Dental implants can offer a nice alternative to poorly fitting dentures or bridges and are therefore preferred over traditional bridges."

      "item2": "Digital Design",
      "item2Content":"The tooth design is done digitally on the scan image. All processes such as the shape of the tooth, its contours, and its compatibility with the gum are designed in a computer environment.",

    "MainContent":"The question of what is digital dentistry is among the topics that many people have been wondering about recently. Digital dentistry is a field where devices, techniques and new technologies that are fully or partially supported by computers are used during diagnosis, planning and treatment. Digital dentistry is among the new generation methods developed to greatly reduce human errors, increase precision in production and shorten the duration of treatments a little bit more. In the field of digital dentistry; many applications that come to mind such as filling, complicated implant treatments, smile design, aesthetic planning, orthodontic procedures and porcelain coating can be performed. Each of these procedures is performed using digital technologies and modern devices."

  "SingleToothImplant": {
    "title": "Is Single Tooth Implant Possible?",
    "content1": "The single tooth implant procedure is the beginning of processes that will be completed in a very short time and successfully. First, it is checked whether there is sufficient bone tissue for the area with the missing tooth. The operation is completed with a procedure that will take 15-30 minutes. Leaving missing teeth empty can cause many different problems in the future.",
    "advantagesTitle": "What is the Advantage of Single Tooth Implant?",
    "advantagesContent": "In previous years, single tooth deficiency was treated with porcelain bridges. For the construction of porcelain bridge teeth, the teeth in front of and behind the missing tooth were reduced in size and used as support legs in the construction of the 'bridge'. Thus, the legs and the missing tooth area were treated with a three-membered bridge prosthetic tooth in total. The advantage of implant treatment in single tooth deficiency is that the tooth deficiency is eliminated without touching other healthy teeth. In this way, the teeth around the missing tooth continue to function in a healthy way.",
    "boneTitle": "Can Implant Treatment Be Applied When There Is Not Enough Bone?",
    "boneContent": "One of the factors that most affect the life of the implant is the presence of healthy bone that will surround the implant. If there is suitable bone tissue, the implant can be placed without any problems. In cases where there is not enough bone, very successful results are achieved with bone powder or bone graft taken from the patient's own tissue.",
    "priceTitle": "Why Do Implant Prices Vary?",
    "priceContent": "Price is one of the most frequently asked questions. This pricing varies according to the exchange rates of world-famous dental implants from Swedish, Swiss, German and American brands. Contact us for the most accurate information.",
    "lifetimeTitle": "How Long Does a Single Tooth Implant Last?",
    "lifetimeContent": "It has been observed that the lifespan of an implant tooth can last 30-40 years in the mouth, even a lifetime without any problems. The question of how long an implant lasts depends on many factors. The person's general health and, more importantly, oral and dental health directly affect the duration.",
    "recoveryTitle": "How Many Days Does It Take to Recover After Implant Treatment?",
    "recoveryContent": "What is the recovery process like after implant treatment? It varies depending on the size of the operation area, the number of screws placed, the surgical technique, and most importantly, how you manage this process. The time required for the healing of a single implant wound and the healing time of bone powder application will not be the same."
