    "MainContent": "Implants are titanium screws that are used to treat missing teeth and are placed inside the jawbone. The dental prosthesis is placed on these screws. The advantage of implant treatment over other treatments is that neighboring teeth are not harmed. In other words, neighboring teeth do not need to be cut. The implant acts as a tooth root and you can eat, talk and laugh comfortably like a natural tooth. Dental implant surgery also involves a surgical process that replaces the tooth roots with metal, screw-like posts and replaces damaged or missing teeth with artificial teeth that look and function very much like real teeth. Dental implants can offer a nice alternative to poorly fitting dentures or bridges and are therefore preferred over traditional bridges."

    "advantagesTitle": "What is the Advantage of Single Tooth Implant?",
    "advantagesContent": "In previous years, single tooth deficiency was treated with porcelain bridges. For the construction of porcelain bridge teeth, the teeth in front of and behind the missing tooth were reduced in size and used as support legs in the construction of the 'bridge'. Thus, the legs and the missing tooth area were treated with a three-membered bridge prosthetic tooth in total. The advantage of implant treatment in single tooth deficiency is that the tooth deficiency is eliminated without touching other healthy teeth. In this way, the teeth around the missing tooth continue to function in a healthy way.",
