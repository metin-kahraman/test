    "MainContent": "Implants are titanium screws that are used to treat missing teeth and are placed inside the jawbone. The dental prosthesis is placed on these screws. The advantage of implant treatment over other treatments is that neighboring teeth are not harmed. In other words, neighboring teeth do not need to be cut. The implant acts as a tooth root and you can eat, talk and laugh comfortably like a natural tooth. Dental implant surgery also involves a surgical process that replaces the tooth roots with metal, screw-like posts and replaces damaged or missing teeth with artificial teeth that look and function very much like real teeth. Dental implants can offer a nice alternative to poorly fitting dentures or bridges and are therefore preferred over traditional bridges."

    "MainContent":"The question of what is digital dentistry is among the topics that many people have been wondering about recently. Digital dentistry is a field where devices, techniques and new technologies that are fully or partially supported by computers are used during diagnosis, planning and treatment. Digital dentistry is among the new generation methods developed to greatly reduce human errors, increase precision in production and shorten the duration of treatments a little bit more. In the field of digital dentistry; many applications that come to mind such as filling, complicated implant treatments, smile design, aesthetic planning, orthodontic procedures and porcelain coating can be performed. Each of these procedures is performed using digital technologies and modern devices."
